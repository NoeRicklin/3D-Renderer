* The vertex-scaler in line 77 should be dynamicly generated in respect to the window length, the fov and the viewplane distance
* The Camera can't turn up/down, because the cam_right and cam_up directions wouldn't work (Possible solution could make use of the fact, that I don't need the cam_right to leave the xz-plane, but it seems inelegant)
